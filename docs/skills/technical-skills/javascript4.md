**About:**  
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. It is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

**Topics Covered:**

- Promise
- Async and await
- Difference between bind, apply, and call
- Higher-order function
